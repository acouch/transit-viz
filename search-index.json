The Minimum Data Set (MDS) is part of the federally mandated process for clinical assessment of all residents in Medicare or Medicaid certified nursing homes. This process provides a comprehensive assessment of each residents functional capabilities and helps nursing home staff identify health problems. Resident Assessment Protocols (RAPs), are part of this process, and provide the foundation upon which a residents individual care plan is formulated. MDS assessment forms are completed for all residents in certified nursing homes, regardless of source of payment for the individual resident. MDS assessments are required for residents on admission to the nursing facility and then periodically, within specific guidelines and time frames. In most cases, participants in the assessment process are licensed health care professionals employed by the nursing home. MDS information is transmitted electronically by nursing homes to the MDS database in their respective States. MDS information from the State databases is captured into the national MDS database at CMS. Data from the MDS for 1st quarter 2005 through 3rd quarter 2010 are reported. In future years, this measure will be changing to percentage of long-term nursing facility residents with major falls. The data source will then be MDS 3.0.</p>  dcat:Distribution https://healthmeasures.aspe.hhs.gov/measure/28 application/unknown Resource resource-eff34ee2-64c6-48ae-8ec5-aab824e8a48c undefined 279 Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Activity Limitation External Source Medicare Advantage Skilled Nursing (SNF)  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2016-07-22  009:000 org:Organization Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Nursing Home - Falls within the Past 30 days"},"284":{"identifier":"284","title":"Chronic Condition Public Use File (PUF)","keyword":["Chronic Condition","Publically Available Data File - for download"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public  009:38 Health Data Initiative mailto:cms.data@cms.hhs.gov <p>This release contains the Chronic Conditions Public Use Files (PUF) with information from Medicare claims.

The study focuses on the personal health care (PHC) sector, which includes the goods and services rendered to treat or prevent a specific disease or condition in an individual. The official 2007 NHEA estimate for PHC spending is 1,915 billion dollars and the MEPS estimate is 1,126 billion dollars. Adjusting the NHEA estimates for differences in underlying populations, covered services, and other measurement concepts reduces the NHEA estimate for 2007 to 1,366 billion dollars. As a result, MEPS is 240 billion dollars, or 17.6 percent less than the adjusted NHEA total. The reconciliation provides a consistent baseline of health expenditure data for policy simulations, enabling researchers to adjust MEPS to be consistent with the NHEA so that the projected costs, as well as budgetary and tax implications of any policy change are consistent with national health spending estimates.</p>  dcat:Distribution http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Articles/A2012/mmrr-2012-002-04-a09.html application/unknown Resource resource-82c81939-3b0e-4ca6-bf5f-37454c102675 undefined 407 Home Health (HHA) Payment Sources  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2016-07-22  009:000 org:Organization Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Reconciling Medical Expenditure Estimates from the MEPS..."},"412":{"identifier":"412","title":"Medicaid CHIP ESPC Database","keyword":["Covered Services","Medicaid Managed Care","Publically Available Data File - for download"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public  009:38 Health Data Initiative mailto:cms.data@cms.hhs.gov <p>The Environmental Scanning and Program Characteristic (ESPC) Database is in a Microsoft (MS) Access format and contains Medicaid and CHIP data, for the 50 states and District of Columbia.

Medicare payments include both geographic and policy-based facility type differentials (e.g., wage index and disproportionate share hospital), which can bias cost comparisons of hospitals and averages across geographic areas. Standardizing payment information to remove the area- and policy-based payment differentials should normalize much of the observed geographic variability in payments, allowing for a more accurate comparison of resource use between providers and across geographic regions. Use of standardized payments will ensure that observed payment variation is due to differences in practice patterns and service use, rather than Medicare payment differences over which the providers have no control.

The population examined, people 65 years and older with chronic illnesses, have an overall awareness of 13 percent, similar to the general population. Age, race, education, and self-reported health status are associated with greater awareness of physician quality information (PQI), as are trust in the Internet as a source of health care information and not trusting ones physician as an information source. Population trends over time will not likely improve awareness, nor will increases in patient activation or satisfaction with care-both goals of recent Medicare initiatives.

The study followed 34,400 enrollees in the Alabama Childrens Health Insurance Program, ALL Kids, whose copayment increased in fiscal year 2004, and compared their patterns of prescription drug spending before and after the increase. The percent of children with any expense for prescription drugs decreased by 5.8 percent. Among those with prescription fills, expenses decreased by 7.9 percent. The largest decline was for antihistamine drugs, the smallest for central nervous system agents, which include antidepressants. Children with chronic conditions were less responsive to the copayment increase.

Alternative weighting schemes were compared using estimates from different approaches and with CMS administrative data counts where applicable.

High health center penetration among low-income populations may accrue Medicare cost savings without compromising clinical quality.</p>  dcat:Distribution http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Articles/A2014/MMRR2014_004_03_a05.html application/unknown Resource resource-8a86b35b-a309-4ee5-8df5-9ad0f051ede0 undefined 530  Hospital Referral Region  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2016-07-22  009:000 org:Organization Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Costs and Clinical Quality Among Medicare Beneficiaries.."},"531":{"identifier":"531","title":"Potential Medicaid Cost Savings from Maternity Care Based..","keyword":["centers-for-medicare-amp-medicaid-services"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public  009:38 Health Data Initiative mailto:mmrr-editors@cms.hhs.gov <p>Medicaid pays for about half the births in the United States, at very high cost. Compared to usual obstetrical care, care by midwives at a birth center could reduce costs to the Medicaid program, according to Potential Medicaid Cost Savings from Maternity Care Based at a Freestanding Birth Center, published in Volume 4, Issue 3 of Medicare and Medicaid Research Review. This study draws on information from a previous study of the maternal and infant outcomes of birth center care to determine whether such care reduces Medicaid costs for low income women. Costs to Medicaid are derived from birth center data and from other national sources of the cost of obstetrical care. The authors estimate that birth center care could save an average of 1,164 dollars per birth (2008 constant dollars), or 11.6 million dollars per 10,000 births per year. As Medicaid faces continuing cost increases and budget constraints, policy makers may want to consider a larger role for midwives and birth centers in maternity care for low-risk Medicaid pregnant women.</p>  dcat:Distribution http://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Articles/A2014/MMRR2014_004_03_a06.html application/unknown Resource resource-31391a8e-2554-4804-9f18-69bdbc053a84 undefined 531  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2016-07-22  009:000 org:Organization Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Potential Medicaid Cost Savings from Maternity Care Based..  centers-for-medicare-amp-medicaid-services"},"532":{"identifier":"532","title":"The HCBS Taxonomy- A New Language for Classifying Home...","keyword":["Long Term Care (LTC)"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public  009:38 Health Data Initiative mailto:mmrr-editors@cms.hhs.gov <p>The home- and community-based services (HCBS) taxonomy provides a common language for describing and categorizing HCBS across Medicaid programs. Prior to the taxonomy, only aggregate state-level HCBS expenditure data were available, however, policy initiatives to expand HCBS use among Medicaid beneficiaries who use long-term services and supports (LTSS) have created a need for more detailed analyses of HCBS use and spending. Authors of The HCBS Taxonomy - A New Language for Classifying Home- and Community-Based Services, published in Volume 4, Issue 3 of Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, demonstrate how applying the HCBS taxonomy to claims available in Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) data allows for detailed analysis of HCBS spending and service at the state, service, and person levels.

Many private insurers implemented similar non-payment policies. Financial impact of the policy to hospitals and insurers was viewed as minimal because of the low rate of HACs, but patient advocates noted that calculations do not account for downstream costs of HACs to CMS and taxpayers.

The overall goal of the Development of Quality Indicators for Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (IRFs) project was to assist CMS in developing appropriate measures to monitor and evaluate the quality of rehabilitation services provided to Medicare beneficiaries in IRFs. The key questions addressed by this report include - What are the expected outcomes of an inpatient rehabilitation stay, What factors affect those outcomes, Do we have appropriate measures of those relationships, And if not, what measures do we need, Funded by CMS, in considering these key questions, Research Triangle Institute (RTI) incorporated expertise from the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation services to develop measures specific to the rehabilitation field that would target these issues while still minimizing the administrative reporting burdens for providers.</p>  dcat:Distribution http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/QualityInitiativesGenInfo/index.html application/unknown Resource resource-e047aec0-3aaf-440c-9aab-47e0215fb42e undefined 583 Home Health (HHA) Long Term Care (LTC) Quality Improvement Organization  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2016-07-22  009:000 org:Organization Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Quality Initiatives - General Information"},"584":{"identifier":"584","title":"Health Insurance Marketplace Quality Initiatives","keyword":["Health Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS)","Health Insurance Marketplace","Publically Available Data File - for download"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public  009:38 Health Data Initiative mailto:cms.data@cms.hhs.gov <p>The Affordable Care Act requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop quality data collection and reporting tools such as a Quality Rating System (QRS), a Quality Improvement Strategy (QIS) and an enrollee satisfaction survey system (ESS). The QRS, QIS, and ESS will inform consumer selection of a qualified health plan (QHP), decisions about QHP certification, and the Federal and State Marketplaces monitoring of QHP performance. The QRS is a system that rates QHPs based on relative quality and price. Documents describing the QRS data collection guidelines, technical specifications, and the QRS measures are available on this page. CMS is developing two consumer experience surveys to assess consumers and enrollees experiences with the Marketplaces and QHPs. The Health Insurance Marketplace Survey (Marketplace Survey) is intended to obtain consumers perspectives on the services provided by Marketplaces. Conducted during the 2014 open enrollment period, the purpose of the usability testing was to determine whether the State-Based Marketplace Web sites adopted principles for making a Web site usable for consumers and whether information about determining eligibility, comparing and choosing a health plan, and enrollment was easy to find. Results from this assessment are available on this page. The Qualified Health Plan Enrollee Experience Survey (QHP Enrollee Survey) is intended to obtain enrollees perspectives on the services provided by QHPs offered through the Marketplaces.

The HCAHPS survey is also known as the CAHPS Hospital Survey or Hospital CAHPS. HCAHPS is a core set of questions that can be combined with a broader, customized set of hospital-specific items. HCAHPS survey items complement the data hospitals currently collect to support improvements in internal customer services and quality related activities. The HCAHPS survey contains 21 patient perspectives on care and patient rating items that encompass nine key topics- communication with doctors, communication with nurses, responsiveness of hospital staff, pain management, communication about medicines, discharge information, cleanliness of the hospital environment, quietness of the hospital environment, and transition of care. The survey also includes four screener questions and seven demographic items, which are used for adjusting the mix of patients across hospitals and for analytical purposes. The survey is 32 questions in length. HCAHPS On-Line, the official HCAHPS Web site, houses a series of tables that summarize current and historic HCAHPS results.

CHIPRA required HHS to identify and publish a core measure set of childrens health care quality measures for voluntary use by State Medicaid and CHIP programs. On December 29, 2009, the Secretary posted for public comment in the Federal Register, an initial core set of 24 childrens health care quality measures for voluntary use by Medicaid and CHIP programs. The core set includes a range of childrens quality measures encompassing both physical and mental health. The 2015 Child Core Set was released through a December 2014 Informational Bulletin. The CHIPRA legislation provides that the Secretary shall issue updates to the Child Core Set beginning in January 2013 and annually thereafter. CMS worked with the National Quality Forums (NQF) Measures Application Partnership (MAP) to review the Child Core Set and to identify ways to improve it. A background report contains information on the MAPs review process, selection criteria, and feedback to CMS. State data derived from the core measures are part of the Secretarys Annual Report on the Quality of Care for Children in Medicaid and CHIP. States can voluntarily report the Child Core Set measures by using the 2015 Technical Specifications and Resource Manual. A summary of updates to the child core set technical specifications and resource manual for FFY 2015 is also available. CMS also has other initiatives that relate to childrens quality measures, including a Pediatric Quality Measures Program (PQMP) and the Pediatric Electronic Health Record Format.

Questions include age at first use, as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drugs: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine (including crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, tobacco, pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covers substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and includes questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, perceptions of risks, and needle-sharing. Demographic data include gender, race, age, ethnicity, educational level, job status, income level, veteran status, household composition, and population density.</p>\n<p>The questionnaire was significantly redesigned in 1994. The 1994 survey for the first time included a rural population supplement to allow separate estimates to be calculated for this population. Other modules have been added each year and retained in subsequent years: mental health and access to care (1994-B); risk/availability of drugs (1996); cigar smoking and new questions on marijuana and cocaine use (1997); question series asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17 (1997); questions on tobacco brand (1999); marijuana purchase questions (2001); prior marijuana and cigarette use, additional questions on drug treatment, adult mental health services, and social environment (2003); and adult and adolescent depression questions derived from the National Comorbidity Survey, Replication (NCS-R) and National Comorbidity Survey, Adolescent (NCS-A) (2004).</p>\n<p>Survey administration and sample design were improved with the implementation of the 1999 survey, and additional improvements were made in 2002. Since 1999, the survey sample has employed a 50-state design with an independent, multistage area probability sample for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. At this time, the collection mode of the survey changed from personal interviews and self-enumerated answer sheets to using computer-assisted personal interviews and audio computer-assisted self interviews. In 2002, the survey's title was officially changed to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Participants have been given $30 for participating in the study since then. This has resulted in an increase in participation rates from the years prior to 2002. Also, since 2002 the new population data from the 2000 decennial census has been used for sample weighting procedures. For these reasons, data gathered for 2002 and beyond cannot validly be compared to data prior to 2002.</p>\n<p>The NSDUH is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.</p>  dcat:Distribution http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/SAMHDA/series/64 application/unknown csv CSV csv-c04816c5-a860-441b-aa7b-323606f7279f undefined c3f3d29f-4fdb-4ece-9ba5-8c9f38de5a2d addiction alcohol alcohol abuse alcohol consumption amphetamines barbiturates cocaine controlled drugs crack cocaine demographics depression drinking behavior drug abuse drug dependence drug treatment drug use drugs employment hallucinogens health care heroin households income inhalants marijuana mental health mental health services methamphetamine pain relievers pregnancy prescription drugs sedatives smoking stimulants substance abuse substance abuse treatment tobacco use tranquilizers youths  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2016-05-02 org:Organization Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health &amp; Human Services 1989-12-31T19:00:00-05:00/2011-12-30T19:00:00-05:00 1990 through 2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)  009:000 public"},"0e0921f7-7874-48df-a0ef-225dabd99604":{"identifier":"0e0921f7-7874-48df-a0ef-225dabd99604","title":"1992 through 2010 Treatment Episode Data Set - Admissions (TEDS-A)","keyword":["alcohol abuse","drug abuse","drug treatment","health care services","health insurance","intervention","mental health","substance abuse","substance abuse treatment","treatment admissions","treatment programs"],"all":"dcat:Dataset admin mailto:HealthData@hhs.gov http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/SAMHDA/ssvd/series/56/variables <p>The Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) is an administrative data system providing descriptive information about the national flow of admissions to providers of substance abuse treatment. The TEDS is a continuation of the former Client Data System (CDS) that was originally developed by the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services Administration (predecessor to SAMHSA) in consultation with representatives of the state substance abuse agencies and appropriate national organizations. TEDS is one of the three components of SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS)). The core of BHSIS is the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS), formerly known as the National Master Facility Inventory (NMFI). The I-SATS is a continuously-updated comprehensive listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities. The third component of BHSIS is the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS), formerly called the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS) survey. The N-SSATS is an annual survey of the location, characteristics, and utilization of alcoholism and drug abuse treatment facilities. The N-SSATS/UFDS is available from the SAMHDA Web site. Together, they provide national- and state-level information on the numbers and characteristics of individuals admitted to alcohol and drug treatment and describe the facilities that deliver care to those individuals. TEDS includes facilities that are licensed or certified by the state substance abuse agency to provide substance abuse treatment (or are administratively tracked for other reasons), and that are required by the states to provide TEDS client-level data. While compromising a significant proportion of all admissions to substance abuse treatment, TEDS does not include all such admissions. The scope of admissions included in TEDS is affected by differences in state reporting practices, varying definitions of treatment admission, availability of public funds, and public funding constraints. In 1997, TEDS was estimated to include 83 percent of TEDS-eligible admissions and 67 percent of all known admissions. See the full documentation for additional information.</p>\n<p>The TEDS series was designed to provide annual data on the number and characteristics of persons admitted to public and private substance abuse treatment programs receiving public funding. TEDS includes both Minimum Data Set (MDS) data (required reporting) and Supplemental Data Set (SuDS) data (optional reporting), as reported to state substance abuse agencies by the treatment programs. Additional variables, such as calculated age and census region, are added to the state data. TEDS provides information on service setting, number of prior treatments, primary source of referral, employment status, whether methadone was prescribed in treatment, presence of psychiatric problems, living arrangements, health insurance, substance(s) abused, route of administration, age at first use, pregnancy and veteran status, number of days waiting to enter treatment, and demographic variables.</p>\n<p>The TEDS data collection effort began in 1989 with three-year development grants to states. Within each state, treatment providers that receive any state agency funding, including the federal Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant monies, are expected to provide TEDS data for all clients admitted to treatment, regardless of the source of funding for individual clients.</p>\n<p>TEDS is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.</p>  dcat:Distribution http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/SAMHDA/series/56 application/unknown csv CSV csv-51d6fb4a-3f5e-4d1f-8d9d-dfdb6e7da339 undefined 0e0921f7-7874-48df-a0ef-225dabd99604 alcohol abuse drug abuse drug treatment health care services health insurance intervention mental health substance abuse substance abuse treatment treatment admissions treatment programs  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2016-05-02 org:Organization Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health &amp; Human Services 1991-12-31T19:00:00-05:00/2010-12-29T19:00:00-05:00 1992 through 2010 Treatment Episode Data Set - Admissions (TEDS-A)  009:000 public"},"f5e2cefa-4483-4724-bd3c-2934344d5834":{"identifier":"f5e2cefa-4483-4724-bd3c-2934344d5834","title":"1997 through 2010 National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS)","keyword":["alcohol abuse","drug abuse","drug treatment","health care services","hiv","intervention","substance abuse","substance abuse treatment","treatment facilities","treatment programs"],"all":"dcat:Dataset admin mailto:HealthData@hhs.gov http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/SAMHDA/ssvd/series/58/variables <p>The National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) (formerly titled Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS)) is designed to collect information from all facilities in the United States, both public and private, that provides substance abuse treatment. N-SSATS is one of three components of SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS)) and is designed to provide the mechanism for quantifying the dynamic character and composition ofthe United States substance abuse treatment delivery system. In 1995, SAMHSA created BHSIS (formerly DASIS) to facilitate the integration of its existing treatment service's datasets and to reduce redundancy in data collection and reporting. The other two BHSIS components are the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS) and the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). The I-SATS is a comprehensive listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities in the United States. The TEDS is a client-level database of individuals admitted to publicly funded substance abuse treatment facilities and is available from the SAMHDA Web site. Together, these three BHSIS components provide national- and state-level data on persons receiving alcohol and substance abuse treatment as well as data on the facilities providing the treatment.</p>\n<p>Data collected in N-SSATS include topics covering ownership, services offered (assessment and pre-treatment, testing, transitional, ancillary, pharmacotherapies), primary focus (substance abuse, mental health, both, general health, other), hotline operation, methadone/Levo-Alpha Acetyl Methadol (LAAM)/buprenorphine dispensing, counseling and therapeutic approaches, special programs or groups, languages in which treatment is provided, type of treatment provided, number of clients (total and under age 18), number of beds, types of payment accepted, sliding fee scale, and facility accreditation and licensure/certification.</p>\n<p>The data elements and format that make up the core of the N-SSATS were first used in 1976 as part of survey efforts designed to measure the scope and use of drug abuse treatment services in the United States. This core was used throughout the 1970s and 1980s in several different surveys. In 1987 the first administration of the National Drug and Alcoholism Treatment Unit Survey (NDATUS) took place, and then occurred annually from 1989 to 1993. After the creation of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 1992, NDATUS was redesigned as the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS), which was conducted from 1995 to 1998. In 1999, an abbreviated survey was conducted and the survey was redesigned. The 1999 study is not publicly available. In 2000, the full survey was conducted and renamed the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS).</p>\n<p>N-SSATS is a point-prevalence survey. It provides information on the substance abuse treatment system and its clients on the reference date. Client counts reported here do not represent annual totals. Rather, N-SSATS provides a \"snapshot\" of substance abuse treatment facilities and clients on an average day. Through 2000, the N-SSATS reference date was October 1. In 2001, SAMHSA changed the reference date to the last business day in March. This change helped increase the timeliness of responses by individual facilities, but resulted in no data being collected for 2001. Therefore, 2002 marked the first year data were collected using the new reference date.</p>\n<p>The N-SSATS is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.</p>  dcat:Distribution http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/SAMHDA/series/58 application/unknown csv CSV csv-bb08ea0e-ea3a-4ae0-a3ea-1721d81169a5 undefined f5e2cefa-4483-4724-bd3c-2934344d5834 alcohol abuse drug abuse drug treatment health care services hiv intervention substance abuse substance abuse treatment treatment facilities treatment programs  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2016-05-02 org:Organization Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health &amp; Human Services 1997-01-09T19:00:00-05:00/2010-03-09T19:00:00-05:00 1997 through 2010 National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS)  009:000 public"},"4f47324e-307a-414b-9d3a-8ef27bb60860":{"identifier":"4f47324e-307a-414b-9d3a-8ef27bb60860","title":"2004 through 2010 Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN)","keyword":["Drug Related Emergency Department Visits"],"all":"dcat:Dataset admin mailto:HealthData@hhs.gov http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/SAMHDA/ssvd/series/97/variables <p>The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) is a nationally representative public health surveillance system that continuously monitors drug-related visits to hospital emergency departments (EDs). A DAWN case is any ED visit involving recent drug use that is implicated in the ED visit. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. Annually, DAWN produces estimates of drug-related visits to hospital EDs for the nation as a whole and for selected metropolitan areas.</p>\n<p>DAWN is used to monitor trends in drug misuse and abuse, identify the emergence of new substances and drug combinations, assess health hazards associated with drug abuse, and estimate the impact of drug misuse and abuse on the Nation's health care system. DAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. The dataset includes demographics, up to 16 drugs involved in the ED visit, toxicology confirmation, route of administration, type of case, and disposition of the patient following the visit.</p>  dcat:Distribution http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/SAMHDA/series/97 application/unknown csv CSV csv-581a0801-fead-4615-9cf3-b76c21b605c9 undefined 4f47324e-307a-414b-9d3a-8ef27bb60860  Drug Related Emergency Department Visits  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2016-05-02 org:Organization Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health &amp; Human Services 2003-12-31T19:00:00-05:00/2010-12-30T19:00:00-05:00 2004 through 2010 Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN)  009:000 public"},"88ecbbaf-9907-49e7-b123-3699de74999e":{"identifier":"88ecbbaf-9907-49e7-b123-3699de74999e","title":"2011 Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Caseload Data - Number of Families and Recipients","keyword":["administration-for-children-and-families-department-of-health-amp-human-services"],"all":"dcat:Dataset R/P1M admin mailto:HealthData@hhs.gov <p>This is an excel table for the 2011 TANF and Separate State Program - Maintenance of Effort (SSP-MOE) Caseload Data which includes the following data elements: Total Number of Recipients, Total Number of Families, Total Number of Children, 1-Parent Families, 2-Parent Families, 0-Parent Families, Total Number of Adults.</p>  dcat:Distribution http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/data-reports/caseload/2011/2011_15months_tanssp.xls application/unknown xls XLS xls-3271de75-0526-4830-924d-3cc5b0dd1e26 undefined 88ecbbaf-9907-49e7-b123-3699de74999e  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2016-05-02 org:Organization Administration for Children and Families, Department of Health &amp; Human Services 2010-12-31T19:00:00-05:00/2010-12-31T19:00:00-05:00 2011 Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Caseload Data - Number of Families and Recipients  009:000  administration-for-children-and-families-department-of-health-amp-human-services public"},"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/uarv-cqnu":{"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/uarv-cqnu","title":"2013-2014 PHAP Associates by State","keyword":["associate","host site","location","phap","program"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public  009:20 &lt;Nobody&gt; mailto:phap@cdc.gov <p>The map illustrates the total number of 2013 and 2014 PHAP associates in each state and U.S. territory.</p> dcat:Distribution https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/uarv-cqnu/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD application/unknown text/xml xsl xsl-f9586ac8-7b71-4313-8445-06c97f6b08e5 undefined dcat:Distribution https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/uarv-cqnu/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD application/unknown text/xml xsl xsl-f9586ac8-7b71-4313-8445-06c97f6b08e5 undefined dcat:Distribution https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/uarv-cqnu/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD application/unknown text/xml xsl xsl-f9586ac8-7b71-4313-8445-06c97f6b08e5 undefined dcat:Distribution https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/uarv-cqnu/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD application/unknown text/xml xsl xsl-f9586ac8-7b71-4313-8445-06c97f6b08e5 undefined https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/uarv-cqnu associate host site location phap program  en 2016-08-04  009:020 org:Organization Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2013-2014 PHAP Associates by State"},"https://data.medicaid.gov/api/views/7ycc-v6ew":{"identifier":"https://data.medicaid.gov/api/views/7ycc-v6ew","title":"2014 Child and Adult Health Care Quality Measures","keyword":["centers-for-medicare-amp-medicaid-services"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public admin mailto:HealthData@hhs.gov <p>Performance rates on frequently reported health care quality measures in the CMS Medicaid/CHIP Child and Adult Core Sets, for FFY 2014 reporting.

This dataset includes 2013, 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2013, 2014), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2009-2013, 2010-2014 estimates.

The FDA uses AERS to monitor for new adverse events and medication errors that might occur with these marketed products. Reporting of adverse events from the point of care is voluntary in the United States. FDA receives some adverse event and medication error reports directly from health care professionals (such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses and others) and consumers (such as patients, family members, lawyers and others). Healthcare professionals and consumers may also report these events to the products' manufacturers. If a manufacturer receives an adverse event report, it is required to send the report to FDA as specified by regulations.  The files listed on this page contain raw data extracted from the AERS database for the indicated time ranges and are not cumulative. Users of these files need to be familiar with creation of relational databases using applications such as ORACLE, Microsoft Office Access, MySQL and IBM DB2 or the use of ASCII files with SAS analytic tools.

The EPA maintains a database called the Air Quality System (AQS) which contains data from approximately 4,000 monitoring stations around the country, mainly in urban areas. Data from the AQS is considered the \"gold standard\" for determining outdoor air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high. CDC and EPA have worked together to develop a statistical model (Downscaler) to make modeled predictions available for environmental public health tracking purposes in areas of the country that do not have monitors and to fill in the time gaps when monitors may not be recording data. This data does not include \"Percent of population in counties exceeding NAAQS (vs. population in counties that either meet the standard or do not monitor PM2.5)\".

Among its major provisions, the Act extends eligibility for submission of Abbreviated New Animal Drug Applications (ANADAs) to all animal drug products approved for safety and effectiveness under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Act also requires that each sponsor of an approved animal drug product submit to the FDA certain information regarding patents held for the animal drug or its method of use. The Act requires that this information, as well as a list of all animal drug products approved for safety and effectiveness, be made available to the public.

Patients with a ratio of less than 0.5 (meaning fewer controller and more rescue medication claims) were 1.5-2.0 times more likely to have a subsequent emergent healthcare visit than children with higher ratios. Providers and payers may consider tracking the asthma medication ratio and using it to signal pediatric patients at high risk for emergent health care visits. This will allow targeted interventions to improve controller medication use in these highest risk patients.

Data were collected on participants<br />\n(clients) across four types of treatment programs, or modalities:<br />\nresidential, residential \"social model,\" nonmethadone outpatient, and<br />\noutpatient methadone (detoxification and maintenance). Data were<br />\ncollected in two phases. In Phase 1, treatment records were abstracted<br />\nfor clients who received treatment or were discharged between October<br />\n1, 1991, and September 30, 1992. In Phase 2, these clients were<br />\nlocated and recruited for a follow-up interview. The CALDATA design<br />\nand procedures included elements from several national treatment<br />\noutcome studies including the Drug Services Research Survey, Services Research Outcomes Study, National<br />\nTreatment Improvement Evaluation Study, and Drug Abuse<br />\nTreatment Outcome Study. The record abstract was designed<br />\nto collect identifying and locating information for interview<br />\nreference during the personal interviewing phase. The abstract also<br />\ncollected demographic, drug, or alcohol use, and treatment and service<br />\ninformation. The follow-up questionnaire covered time periods before,<br />\nduring, and after treatment and focused on topics such as ethnic and<br />\neducational background, drug and alcohol use, mental and physical<br />\nhealth, HIV and AIDS status, drug testing, illegal activities and<br />\ncriminal status, living arrangements and family issues, employment and<br />\nincome, and treatment for drug, alcohol, and mental health<br />\nproblems. Drugs included alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines,<br />\ncocaine powder, crack, downers, hallucinogens, heroin, illegal<br />\nmethadone, inhalants, LSD, marijuana/hashish/THC, methamphetamines and<br />\nother stimulants, narcotics, over-the-counter drugs, PCP, ritalin or<br />\npreludin, and sedatives/hypnotics.

The proportion of custodial parents living below poverty line continues to increase in 2011. The report found that 4.2 million custodial parents lived in poverty in 2011, representing 29 percent of all custodial parents, about twice the poverty rate for the total population.

Congress and OMB now use performance information to support budget decisions. Many state and local governments are requiring similar systems of accountability to document results and justify funding.

Unweighted, it contains data from more than 7 million hospital stays each year. Weighted, it estimates more than 35 million hospitalizations nationally. Indicators from this data source have been computed by personnel in CDC's Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (DHDSP).

The study analyzed administrative data linked with cancer registry data to estimate cost of care for beneficiaries with cardiac disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes, and mental health disorders. The cost increases ranged from 4,385 dollars for cardiac disease to 11,009 dollars for mental health disorders.

Disenrollees incurred 1,021 dollars per month in Medicare payments following disenrollment to FFS in 2007, which was 28 percent higher than predicted based on risk scores used to set MA payment rates. Differences between actual and predicted payments were smaller for disenrollees of Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) and Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) plans than for Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), indicating less biased disenrollment from PPOs and PFFS plans. Analysis of 10 individual MA plans revealed considerable variation in the degree of biased disenrollment.

In FFY 2000, 6.3 million children ages 1 to 20 were reported to receive some form of dental care (either preventive or treatment) the number more than doubled to 15.4 million by FFY 2010. Part of the increase was because the overall number of children covered by Medicaid rose by 12 million (50 percent), but the percentage of children who received dental care climbed appreciably from 29.3. percent in FFY 2000 to 46.4 percent in FFY 2010.</p>\n<p>In that same time period, the number of children ages 1 to 20 receiving preventive dental services climbed from a reported 5.0 million to 13.6 million, while the percentage of children receiving preventive dental services rose from 23.2 to 40.8 percent. For children ages 1 to 20 who received dental treatment services, the reported number rose from 3.3 million in FFY 2000 to 7.6 million in FFY 2010. The percentage of children who obtained dental treatment services increased from 15.3 to 22.9 percent. In FFY 2010, about one sixth of children covered by Medicaid (15.7 percent) ages 6-14 had a dental sealant placed on a permanent molar.</p>\n<p>While most states have made steady progress in improving childrens access to dental care in Medicaid over the past decade, there is still substantial variation across states and more remains to be done.</p> f404b27e-f408-48dc-979f-6cf43dcf175f access-to-care chip medicaid national preventive-services providers publications screenings trends utilization  en 2015-10-30 org:Organization Department of Health &amp;

This burden is especially higher in rural areas, which are known to report higher cancer frequency and death rate. Population based cancer research, aimed at identifying variations in cancer care and improving cancer outcomes in the rural and medically underserved elderly population, is much needed. Unfortunately, such research has been challenging due to limitations in available data sources. The research article, entitled Linking Medicare, Medicaid, and Cancer Registry Data to Study the Burden of Cancers in West Virginia, published in Volume 2, Number 4 of the Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, describes the creation of a comprehensive dataset by combining the West Virginia Cancer Registry with Medicare, Medicaid, and other data sources.

During the household interviews, MEPS collects detailed information for each person in the household on the following: demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical services, charges and source of payments, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance coverage, income, and employment. The panel design of the survey, which features several rounds of interviewing covering two full calendar years, makes it possible to determine how changes in respondents' health status, income, employment, eligibility for public and private insurance coverage, use of services, and payment for care are related. The HC expenditures have been projected to future years by selected demographic characteristics by source of payment and type of service. HC data are available on the MEPS Web site in data tables, downloadable data files (person, job, event, or condition level).

Even though there is a lack of standard definition and identification of a chronic condition, these conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and diabetes, are long-lasting and persistent health problems that require continuous care. Recent research has emphasized the disproportionate share of beneficiaries with chronic conditions in healthcare expenditures (Anderson, 2010). For example, patients with multiple chronic conditions can cost up to seven times as much as patients with only one chronic condition. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chronic diseases are responsible for more than 75 percent of the 2.5 trillion spent annually on health care.

As input, MONAHRQ requires all or any of these: -- hospital administrative data -- precalculated CMS Hospital Compare measure results -- HCAHPS patient survey results For links to live public reporting websites generated using MONAHRQ, please visit <a href=\"http://www.monahrq.ahrq.gov/msites.shtml\">http://www.monahrq.ahrq.gov/msites.shtml</a>.</p>  dcat:Distribution http://monahrq.ahrq.gov/download.shtml application/unknown widget Widget widget-555d308c-4343-4c45-91a6-9a91ae08f7ef undefined 8e9604e5-028d-46ed-8f10-524904d3e60d claims community health diagnoses emergency department hcahps hcup health care health statistics healthcare quality hospital hospital compare inpatient prevention procedures quality reporting software utlization website  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2016-04-05 org:Organization Department of Health &amp; Human Services MONAHRQ  009:000 public"},"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rq85-buyi":{"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rq85-buyi","title":"Monthly Page Views to CDC.gov","keyword":["cdc.gov","web metrics"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public  009:20 CDC INFO mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov <p>For more information on CDC.gov metrics please see <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/metrics/\">http://www.cdc.gov/metrics/</a></p> dcat:Distribution https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rq85-buyi/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD application/unknown text/xml xsl xsl-99572d7d-9217-44a2-9f55-3876d5357cb1 undefined dcat:Distribution https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rq85-buyi/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD application/unknown text/xml xsl xsl-99572d7d-9217-44a2-9f55-3876d5357cb1 undefined dcat:Distribution https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rq85-buyi/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD application/unknown text/xml xsl xsl-99572d7d-9217-44a2-9f55-3876d5357cb1 undefined dcat:Distribution https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rq85-buyi/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD application/unknown text/xml xsl xsl-99572d7d-9217-44a2-9f55-3876d5357cb1 undefined https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rq85-buyi cdc.gov web metrics  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2017-07-07  009:020 org:Organization Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Monthly Page Views to CDC.gov"},"ad5704d8-1efe-49a4-87ee-471cabc03fd1":{"identifier":"ad5704d8-1efe-49a4-87ee-471cabc03fd1","title":"Monthly PDP Enrollment by State,County,Contract","keyword":["county","enrollment","medicare-advantage","part-d","prescription-drug-plans","publically-available-data-file--for-download","state"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public  009:38 admin mailto:HealthData@hhs.gov <p>Monthly Prescription Drug Plan Enrollment by State, County, Contract</p> ad5704d8-1efe-49a4-87ee-471cabc03fd1 county enrollment medicare-advantage part-d prescription-drug-plans publically-available-data-file--for-download state  en 2015-10-30 org:Organization Department of Health &amp; Human Services Monthly PDP Enrollment by State,County,Contract  009:000"},"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rqg5-mkef":{"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rqg5-mkef","title":"Motor Vehicle Occupant Death Rate, by Age and Gender, 2012 &amp; 2014, All States","keyword":["death rate","motor vehicle"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public  009:20 CDC INFO mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov <p>Rate of deaths by age/gender (per 100,000 population) for motor vehicle occupants killed in crashes, 2012 &amp; 2014. 2012 Source: Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS). 2014 Source: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), 2014 Annual Report File Note: Blank cells indicate data are suppressed.

Data elements include the demographics of children and their perpetrators, types of maltreatment, investigation or assessment dispositions, risk factors, and services provided as a result of the investigation or assessment.</p> dcat:Distribution https://www.healthdata.gov/sites/default/files/Findings%20from%20NCANDS%20%E2%80%93%20File%20Contents%20and%20Definitions%20for%20the%20Data%20Tables%20%28updated%20with%20FY%202015%29.docx application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document docx Findings from the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) – File Contents and Definitions for the Data Tables (updated with FY 2015) findings-from-the-national-child-abuse-and-neglect-data-system-ncands-file-contents-and-definitions-for-the-data-tables-updated-with-fy-2015-95a261d1-59d0-4b46-8e24-b8608b85c7af undefined dcat:Distribution https://www.healthdata.gov/sites/default/files/Findings%20from%20NCANDS%20%E2%80%93%20File%20Contents%20and%20Definitions%20for%20the%20Data%20Tables%20%28updated%20with%20FY%202015%29.docx application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document docx Findings from the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) – File Contents and Definitions for the Data Tables (updated with FY 2015) findings-from-the-national-child-abuse-and-neglect-data-system-ncands-file-contents-and-definitions-for-the-data-tables-updated-with-fy-2015-95a261d1-59d0-4b46-8e24-b8608b85c7af undefined dcat:Distribution https://www.healthdata.gov/sites/default/files/Findings%20from%20NCANDS%20%E2%80%93%20File%20Contents%20and%20Definitions%20for%20the%20Data%20Tables%20%28updated%20with%20FY%202015%29.docx application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document docx Findings from the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) – File Contents and Definitions for the Data Tables (updated with FY 2015) findings-from-the-national-child-abuse-and-neglect-data-system-ncands-file-contents-and-definitions-for-the-data-tables-updated-with-fy-2015-95a261d1-59d0-4b46-8e24-b8608b85c7af undefined 6820d1cb-0e93-4870-b6e0-4a33d84122c1 child abuse child maltreatment child safety  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2017-01-17 org:Organization Administration for Children and Families 2009-12-31T19:00:00-05:00/2009-12-31T19:00:00-05:00 National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) Child File  009:000"},"137eefd2-b9e8-4b6f-8ec7-fb3f537ffe33":{"identifier":"137eefd2-b9e8-4b6f-8ec7-fb3f537ffe33","title":"National Coverage Determinations - Reports to Congress","keyword":["covered-services","medicare","national","payments","pharmacy","prescription-drugs","reports","suppliers"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public  009:38 admin mailto:HealthData@hhs.gov <p>Various national coverage activities, including Reports to Congress.</p> 137eefd2-b9e8-4b6f-8ec7-fb3f537ffe33 covered-services medicare national payments pharmacy prescription-drugs reports suppliers  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2016-04-05 org:Organization Department of Health &amp; Human Services National Coverage Determinations - Reports to Congress  009:000"},"47fd0b8c-191e-4395-8cd1-823c18ce8689":{"identifier":"47fd0b8c-191e-4395-8cd1-823c18ce8689","title":"National Database for Autism Research (NDAR)","keyword":["national-institutes-of-health-nih"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public  009:00 Farber, Greg mailto:farberg@mail.nih.gov <p>National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) is an extensible, scalable informatics platform for austism spectrum disorder-relevant data at all levels of biological and behavioral organization (molecules, genes, neural tissue, behavioral, social and environmental interactions) and for all data types (text, numeric, image, time series, etc.).

Since 1960, the survey has been conducted by NCHS, which was formed when the National Health Survey and the National Vital Statistics Division were combined.<br />\nNHIS data are used widely throughout the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to monitor trends in illness and disability and to track progress toward achieving national health objectives. The data are also used by the public health research community for epidemiologic and policy analysis of such timely issues as characterizing those with various health problems, determining barriers to accessing and using appropriate health care, and evaluating Federal health programs.<br />\nThe NHIS also has a central role in the ongoing integration of household surveys in DHHS. The designs of two major DHHS national household surveys have been or are linked to the NHIS. The National Survey of Family Growth used the NHIS sampling frame in its first five cycles and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey currently uses half of the NHIS sampling frame. Other linkage includes linking NHIS data to death certificates in the National Death Index (NDI).<br />\nWhile the NHIS has been conducted continuously since 1957, the content of the survey has been updated about every 10-15 years. In 1996, a substantially revised NHIS questionnaire began field testing. This revised questionnaire, described in detail below, was implemented in 1997 and has improved the ability of the NHIS to provide important health information.</p> a8f0a8b3-d514-4b7f-9572-17df46727789  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2016-04-05 org:Organization Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health &amp; Human Services National Health Interview Survey  009:000  centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-department-of-health-amp-human-services public"},"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/xtkc-juf3":{"identifier":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/xtkc-juf3","title":"National Hospice Item Set (HIS) data","keyword":["care","hospice","hospice care","list"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public  009:38 admin mailto:HealthData@hhs.gov <p>This data set includes the national averages (mean) for quality measure scores of Medicare-certified hospice agencies calculated from the Hospice Item Set (HIS) for July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016.</p> dcat:Distribution https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/xtkc-juf3/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD application/unknown text/xml xsl xsl-7674165b-faac-4472-82a6-c90a9ce8a5f8 undefined dcat:Distribution https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/xtkc-juf3/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD application/unknown text/xml xsl xsl-7674165b-faac-4472-82a6-c90a9ce8a5f8 undefined dcat:Distribution https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/xtkc-juf3/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD application/unknown text/xml xsl xsl-7674165b-faac-4472-82a6-c90a9ce8a5f8 undefined dcat:Distribution https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/xtkc-juf3/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD application/unknown text/xml xsl xsl-7674165b-faac-4472-82a6-c90a9ce8a5f8 undefined https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/xtkc-juf3 care hospice hospice care list  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2017-06-03  009:078 org:Organization Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services National Hospice Item Set (HIS) data"},"063e7e53-4790-45ac-a2ef-0f65351c726d":{"identifier":"063e7e53-4790-45ac-a2ef-0f65351c726d","title":"National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey","keyword":["centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-department-of-health-amp-human-services"],"all":"dcat:Dataset  009:20 admin mailto:HealthData@hhs.gov http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ahcd/ahcd_questionnaires.htm <p>The National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) is designed to collect data on the utilization and provision of ambulatory care services in hospital emergency and outpatient departments and in ambulatory surgery centers.

Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions.

The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2014 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.<br />\nThis study has 1 Data Set.</p>  dcat:Distribution https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2014-nid13618 application/unknown html HTML html-0e8245a9-63aa-4387-b536-ab841ebff0c2 undefined https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2014-nid13618 addiction alcohol alcohol abuse alcohol consumption amphetamines barbiturates cocaine controlled drugs crack cocaine demographic characteristics depression (psychology) drinking behavior drug abuse drug dependence drug treatment drug use drugs employment hallucinogens health care heroin households income inhalants marijuana mental health mental health services methamphetamine pregnancy prescription drugs sedatives smoking stimulants substance abuse substance abuse treatment tobacco use tranquilizers youths  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2016-12-20  009:030 org:Organization Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Health Services Administration National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2014)"},"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2015-nid16893":{"identifier":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2015-nid16893","title":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2015)","keyword":["addiction","alcohol","alcohol abuse","alcohol consumption","amphetamines","barbiturates","cocaine","controlled drugs","crack cocaine","demographic characteristics","depression (psychology)","drinking behavior","drug abuse","drug dependence","drug treatment","drug use","drugs","employment","hallucinogens","health care","heroin","households","income","inhalants","marijuana","mental health","mental health services","methamphetamine","pregnancy","prescription drugs","sedatives","smoking","stimulants","substance abuse","substance abuse treatment","tobacco use","tranquilizers","youths"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public  009:30 Brooklyn Lupari, SAMHSA/CBHSQ c/o SAMHDA Support mailto:samhda-support@samhsa.hhs.gov <p>The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and<br />\n    correlates of drug use in the United States.

Mortality is characterized using the underlying cause of death which, for injury deaths, refers to the circumstances of the accident or violence that produced the injury. Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body. Examples of mechanisms of injury include falls, motor vehicle traffic crashes, burns, poisonings, and drownings (1,2). This storyboard allows the user to select subcategories of injury deaths based on intent and mechanism of injury.

NITRC collects and points to standardized information about tools, making the task of finding and comparing them easier than before. The site can help researchers find the right functional or structural neuroimaging tool or resource for their research. NITRC has recently added services such as cloud-based computing and data storage, and is broadening the range of scientific domains from MR to PET, SPECT, CT, MEG/EEG and optical imaging. Additional domains of interest are digital atlasing, and computational neuroscience, including large-scale and multi-scale modeling. The NITRC team searches out relevant research tools and resources to house on the site.

A 10-percent increase in reporting, the equivalent to reporting one more indicator per agency, increased the probability of a home health agency leaving an area with less-educated people by 0.3 percentage points, compared with leaving an area with high education. This small level of market-area exits under public reporting is unlikely to be practically meaningful, suggesting that Home Health Compare did not lead to a disruption in access to home health care through selective exits during the initial year of the program.

Based on evidence-based practices, this program is a smoking cessation intervention for smokers who are ready to quit smoking. Although evidence supports the use of text messaging as a platform to deliver cessation interventions, it is expected that the maximum effect of the program will be demonstrated when it is integrated into other elements of a national tobacco control strategy.  The QuitNowTXT program is designed to deliver tips, motivation, encouragement and fact-based information via unidirectional and interactive bidirectional message formats. The core of the program consists of messages sent to the user based on a scheduled quit day identified by the user. Messages are sent for up to four weeks pre-quit date and up to six weeks post quit date. Messages assessing mood, craving, and smoking status are also sent at various intervals, and the user receives messages back based on the response they have submitted. In addition, users can request assistance in dealing with craving, stress/mood, and responding to slips/relapses by texting specific key words to the QuitNow. Rotating automated messages are then returned to the user based on the keyword. Details of the program are provided below. Texting STOP to the service discontinues further texts being sent.  This option is provided every few messages as required by the United States cell phone providers.  It is not an option to remove this feature if the program is used within the US.  If a web-based registration is used, it is suggested that users provide demographic information such as age, gender, and smoking frequency (daily or almost every day, most days, only a few days a week, only on weekends, a few times a month or less) in addition to their mobile phone number and quit date. This information will be useful for assessing the reach of the program, as well as identifying possible need to develop libraries to specific groups. The use of only a mobile phone-based registration system reduces barriers for participant entry into the program but limits the collection of additional data. At bare minimum, quit date must be collected.  At sign up, participants will have the option to choose a quit date up to one month out. Text messages will start up to 14 days before their specified quit date. Users also have the option of changing their quit date at any time if desired. The program can also be modified to provide texts to users who have already quit within the last month.  One possible adaptation of the program is to include a QuitNowTXT \"light\" version. This adaptation would allow individuals who do not have unlimited text messaging capabilities but would still like to receive support to participate by controlling the number of messages they receive. In the light program, users can text any of the programmed keywords without fully opting in to the program. Program Design: The program is designed as a 14-day countdown to quit date, with subsequent six weeks of daily messages. Each day within the program is identified as either a pre-quit date (Q- # days) or a post-quit date (Q+#). If a user opts into the program fewer than 14 days before their quit date, the system will begin sending messages on that day. For example, if they opt in four days prior to their quit date, the system will send a welcome message and recognize that they are at Q-4 (or four days before their quit date), and they will receive the message that everyone else receives four days before their quit date. As the user progresses throughout the program, they will receive messages outlined in the text message library. Throughout the program, users will receive texts that cover a variety of content areas including tips, informational content, motivational messaging, and keyword responses. The frequency of messages increases as the days leading up to and following the user's quit date, with a heavy emphasis on support, efficacy building, and actionable tips. Further away from a user's quit date, the messages will reduce in frequency. If the user says they have started to smoke again, the system will give them the option of continuing the program as planned or starting over and setting a new quit date.  The system is also designed to assess the user's mood, craving level, and smoking status several times during the program. These assessment messages are characterized as MOOD, CRAVE, and STATUS messages. Whenever the system asks for a response from the user, it will send a programmed response based on the user's answer (i.e., if the user responds with MOOD = BAD then they will receive a message customized to that response). These programmed response messages rotate throughout the course of the program. Users can also send the system one of three programmed keywords (CRAVE, MOOD, and SLIP), and the system will send unique, automated responses based on the texted keyword. There are 10 messages for each of the programmed keywords, which rotate on a random basis, decreasing the likelihood the user will get the same response in a row.  After the full six-week program comes to an end, the system will follow up at one, three, and six months to check on the user's smokefree status and offer additional assistance if needed.  Message Types: -'''¢ Tips: Tips provide users with actionable strategies on how to manage cravings and deal with quitting smoking in general. -'''¢ Motivation/encouragement: Motivational messages encourage users to keep going on their smokefree journey despite the difficulty and struggle they may be facing. -'''¢ Information: Informational messages provide users with facts and other salient points about the impact of smoking relevant to their socio-cultural environment. -'''¢ Assessment: The assessment messages are built into the text messaging program and are designed to collect information about the user's experience as they are quitting and provide immediate feedback based on the user's response. Assessment messages fall along three dimensions: mood, craving, and smoking status. -'''¢ Reactive Messaging (Key Words): At any point, the user can initiate an interaction with the program that will return a text message relevant to the user's request for help. In response to the user texting one of the key words, the system will send them unique, automated responses. The key words cover topics relevant to various aspects of cessation.</p>  dcat:Distribution http://smokefree.gov/health-care-professionals application/unknown html Widget widget-0953354d-aecf-4c96-9cbb-9d0cf39b8468 undefined c90f280f-7c5c-4d12-a648-a521301708c0 cancer cessation cigarettes mobile mobile health quitting smoking text messaging tobacco tobacco control  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2016-05-02 org:Organization National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) QuitNowTXT Text Messaging Library  009:000 public"},"4b957144-a3c2-495a-920f-eede28afed43":{"identifier":"4b957144-a3c2-495a-920f-eede28afed43","title":"Radiation-emitting Electronic Product Codes","keyword":["cdrh"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public  009:10 openFDA mailto:open@fda.hhs.gov http://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/ElectronicProductRadiationControlProgram/GettingaProducttoMarket/PerformanceStandards/ucm135508.htm <p>This database contains product names and associated information developed by the Center for all products, both medical and non-medical, which emit radiation.

Through annual performance reports, Federal agencies provide detailed information on their progress in meeting program performance objectives. Congress and OMB now use performance information to support budget decisions. Many state and local governments are requiring similar systems of accountability to document results and justify funding.  In order to gather information on the performance of its program, the Administration on Aging surveys the participants in its Older Americans Act programs. These national surveys provide a portrait of who receives these services and how they assess the quality of the services received.</p>  dcat:Distribution http://www.aoa.gov/AoARoot/Program_Results/docs/2004/National_Survey/2nd_National_Survey_Data_Files_2004.zip application/unknown csv CSV csv-727785da-b0a2-4c57-bfdc-11fd8f7c742f undefined 4c8ed950-1c53-45fb-a928-8fa9a50c5bbe  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2016-05-02 org:Organization Administration for Community Living, Department of Health &amp; Human Services Second National Survey of Older Americans Act Participants  009:000  administration-for-community-living-department-of-health-amp-human-services public"},"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/crtu-weni":{"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/crtu-weni","title":"Selected Trend Table from Health, United States, 2011.

Although CMS is fairly well protected from the chance that an Accountable Care Organization (ACO) would be rewarded inappropriately for savings that did not truly occur, ACOs are much less protected from the analogous chance that they are inappropriately denied rewards for savings that do occur. Smaller ACOs are especially vulnerable to the chance of being inappropriately denied credit for achieved savings.

The main objective of the UFDS is to produce data that can be used to assess the nature and extent of substance abuse treatment services, to assist in the forecast of treatment resource requirements, to analyze treatment service trends, to conduct national, regional, and state-level comparative analyses of treatment services and utilization, and to generate the National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Programs and its on-line equivalent, the Substance Abuse Treatment Facility Locator <a href=\"http://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/.This\">http://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/.This</a> study has 1 Data Set.</p>  dcat:Distribution https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/uniform-facility-data-set-us-ufds-1998-nid13632 application/unknown html HTML html-65706acf-d6c7-41c7-a1dc-c1c8861cc3a2 undefined https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/uniform-facility-data-set-us-ufds-1998-nid13632 alcohol abuse drug abuse drug treatment health care services intervention substance abuse substance abuse treatment treatment facilities treatment programs  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2016-12-20  009:030 org:Organization Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Health Services Administration Uniform Facility Data Set  US (UFDS-1998)"},"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/68zh-tyt3":{"identifier":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/68zh-tyt3","title":"University of Illinois at Chicago Health Policy Center - Funding Glossary and Methodology","keyword":["glossary","methods"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public  009:20 CDC INFO mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov <p>Download the latest version of the Glossary and Methodology File</p>  dcat:Distribution https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/download/68zh-tyt3/application/vnd.ms-excel application/unknown bin xls xls-818a87b3-3a9a-421b-9847-a3f37c2741de undefined https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/68zh-tyt3 glossary methods  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2017-02-12  009:020 org:Organization Centers for Disease Control and Prevention University of Illinois at Chicago Health Policy Center - Funding Glossary and Methodology"},"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/vw7y-v3uk":{"identifier":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/vw7y-v3uk","title":"University of Illinois at Chicago Health Policy Center - Funding","keyword":["administration and management","allocation","appropriation","best practices","cessation","dollars","expenditure","federal","funding","funds","grants","health communication","interventions","money","office on smoking and health","osh","recommendation","recommended level","spending","state and community","state system","surveillance and evaluation","tobacco"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public  009:20 &lt;Nobody&gt; mailto:OSHData@cdc.gov <p>1991-2014.

In February 2008, Wisconsin expanded and reformed its Medicaid CHIP program and, as part of program implementation, automatically enrolled a set of newly eligible parents and children. This process of auto enrollment targeted newly eligible parents and older children whose children siblings were already enrolled in the states Medicaid CHIP program. Auto enrollment brought over 44,000 individuals into the program, representing more than 60 percent of all enrollees in the first month of the reformed program. Individuals who were auto enrolled were modestly more likely to leave the program relative to other individuals who enrolled in February 2008, unless their incomes were high enough to be required to pay premiums. These auto enrollees were much more likely to exit relative to other enrollees subject to premium payments. The higher exit rates exhibited by non premium paying auto enrollees were likely due to the fact that over 40 percent of auto enrollees were covered by a private insurance policy in the month of their enrollment, compared to approximately 30 percent for regular enrollees. A national simulation of an auto enrollment process similar to Wisconsins, including the expansion of adult Medicaid eligibility to 133 percent of the federal poverty level under the ACA, suggests that 2.5 million of the 5.6 million newly eligible parents could be auto enrolled, and approximately 25 percent of this population would be privately insured. These results suggest that auto enrollment may be appropriate for other states, especially in their efforts to enroll eligible populations who are not subject to premium requirements.</p> 165365dd-01f5-4297-a7f9-93e77e5c3d8e chip eligibility enrollment medicaid part-b publications state  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2016-04-05 org:Organization Department of Health &amp; Human Services Wisconsins Experience with Medicaid Auto Enrollment  009:000"},"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/phjv-pp5v":{"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/phjv-pp5v","title":"Work-Related Lung Disease Surveillance System (eWoRLD)","keyword":["Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public  009:20 &lt;Nobody&gt; mailto:pls1@cdc.gov <p>A surveillance system that provides morbidity, mortality, and workplace exposures data on work-related respiratory diseases by geographic region, industry and occupation, and demographic groups.</p>  dcat:Distribution http://wwwn.cdc.gov/eworld/ application/unknown html html html-6f92d2a2-5744-4519-80f9-2593a2ac069c undefined https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/phjv-pp5v  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  en 2016-08-04  009:020 org:Organization Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Work-Related Lung Disease Surveillance System (eWoRLD)"},"0d8198dc-ba28-4f8b-87ac-b088ec9338d4":{"identifier":"0d8198dc-ba28-4f8b-87ac-b088ec9338d4","title":"WormBase","keyword":["national-institutes-of-health-nih"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public  009:00 GOOD, PETER J. mailto:goodp@mail.nih.gov <p>WormBase is an international consortium of biologists and computer scientists dedicated to providing the research community with accurate, current, accessible information concerning the genetics, genomics and biology of C. elegans and related nematodes.</p> 0d8198dc-ba28-4f8b-87ac-b088ec9338d4  en http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/ 2016-07-18 org:Organization National Institutes of Health (NIH) WormBase  009:000  national-institutes-of-health-nih"},"ba5c276b-d080-4760-88d4-a003e0599095":{"identifier":"ba5c276b-d080-4760-88d4-a003e0599095","title":"X-Ray Assembler Data","keyword":["cdrh"],"all":"dcat:Dataset public  009:10 openFDA mailto:open@fda.hhs.gov <p>Federal regulations require that an assembler who installs one or more certified components of a diagnostic x-ray system submit a report of assembly.
