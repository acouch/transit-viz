# Visuazlising Inequality and other Census Data along transit routes

This still needs a lot of work, but the foundation currently allows the graphing and mapping of census data along transit routes.

Any city with GTFS data can be plugged in. There is a python script to convert GTFS data to produce the stops along each route. GTFS does not provide that by default as the stops along a route could change per day.
